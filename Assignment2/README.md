# Animation Project in C++ using STL Container Classes and Overloaded Operators

##  Description
The Animation is a series of Frames held in a forward_list. Each Frame holds its list of Display
objects in a vector. A Display object contains its display time which is set by the user - therefore the
fixed Frame display time of 1 second that was used in previous assignments is gone and is replaced by
the individual Display times that the user specifies. You can:
- Add a new Frame to the Animation at a position in the forward list selected by the user
- Delete all the Frames in the Animation
- Run the Animation to show the list of Display details of each Frame one after another at the
display intervals specified by the user when the Display was entered â€“ note that the output counts
up the seconds
- concatenate two Frames to make a single Frame with combined Displays that is automatically
added to the start of the forward_list
- Quit
