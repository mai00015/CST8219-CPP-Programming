# Animation Project in C++ using Polymorphic Inheritance and RTTI

##  Description
The Animation is a series of Frames held in a forward_list. Each Frame holds its list of Display* in a
vector. There are now two types of Display, as detailed above, both subclasses of the abstract base
class Display. Each Display object contains its display time which is set by the user. You can:
- Add a new Frame to the Animation at a position in the forward list selected by the user
- Delete all the Frames in the Animation
- Run the Animation to show the list of Display details of each Frame one after another at the
display intervals specified by the user when the Display was entered â€“ note that the output counts
up the seconds using a timer as was done in assignment 0 onwards.
- Quit
